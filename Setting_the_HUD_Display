There is also a circuit diagram added.Pls refer to circuit_diagram.PNG

1) First off insert HUD display into the breadboard 
2) Now grab one of your male to female jumper wires and attach the male end to ground on HUD display. 
   Then attach the female end to pin 6 on the Pi. Pin 6 is also ground!
3) Using another male to female jumper wire attach the pin on HUD display labelled 'Vin' to pin 1 on your Pi. This is our power line.
4) Now we are going to skip over the pin on HUD display that is labelled '3v3'.
   So using a male to female jumper wire connect the pin on HUD display to pin 24 on Pi.
5) Now grab another male to female jumper wire and attach the pin labelled 'Rst' on HUD display
   (the reset pin) to pin 8 of your Pi.
6) Now attach the pin labelled DC on HUD display to pin 10 on Pi...
7) Now grab second-to-last male to female jumper wire and attach it to the 'Clk' pin on HUD display. Then attach the other end to pin 23 on Pi.
8) Finally grab last jumper wire and attach the male end to the last remaining pin of HUD display: the data pin... Then attach the other end to pin 19 on the Pi.
